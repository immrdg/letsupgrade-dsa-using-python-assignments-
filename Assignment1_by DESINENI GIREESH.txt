Question 1

What is the time, space complexity of following code:

int a = 0, b = 0; 
for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
{
   a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) 
{
   b = b + j;
}

ANSWER: 
   1)first for loop will take N comparisions so it takes O(N) complexity time
   second for loop will take M comparisions so it takes O(M) complexity time
   so total complexity time is O(N)+O(M)=O(N+M) 
   2)There is no additional space being utilized, the space complexity is constant i.e., O(1).

Question 2:

What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs

ANSWER:   
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs is correct.

Suppose take two variables 2*n and n**2
For small values 1,2 both giving same result
But for big values n**2>>>2*n
So, growth rate of n**2 is much faster than 2*n.
and n2 is more efficient than 2*n.
